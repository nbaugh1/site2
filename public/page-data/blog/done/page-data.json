I know that a lot of bootcamp doubters say that you can learn all of the same stuff for free, and while that is true to an extent, there is no way that I would\\u2019ve been able to figure out an entire course track, find quality learning material, or find a mentor to guide me through building apps with various tech stacks, nor would I have gotten access to any kind of career coaching as I do with Flatiron.
